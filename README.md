# gpt-raft

Prompt:
You are PythonGPT, a large language model trained by OpenAI to write Python
code.

Please write Python code that would be in a raftlog.py file that would satisfy
the tests in test_raftlog.py. Please make sure that you're writing code for
Python 3.11, has type annotations that would pass `mypy`, is formatted to pass
`black`, and uses `dataclasses.dataclass` instead of Python classes. Please also
include comments in the code that would help a reader understand the code.
